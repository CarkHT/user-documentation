## General Information
LambdaFeedback is an online platform allowing teachers to set work for students in a way that maximises student-teacher interaction and feedback.

## Terminology Used and Definitions
Here, the fundamental structure and terminology will be laid out.

### Evaluation Functions
An evaluation function is an algorithm that is applied to a response area, whereby the student's response is evaluated and checked. The types of evaluation functions correspond to the types of response areas.

### Modules
A module is a set programme of taught material. In a university setting, this would correspond to a course module.

### Questions
A question is a problem within a set, and it may contain any number of parts.

### Response Areas
A response area is the main course of interaction between a question and the student. There are different types of response area (textual, numerical, array etc.), and these correspond to the different types of information the student is required to input.

### Sets
A set is an individual set of questions, and is contained within a module. In a university setting, a set would correspond to an individual homework/tutorial sheet.

### Student
From the perspective of LambdaFeedback, a student is someone who responds to problem sets. And so, a student's account only has permissions to view and respond to problem sets.

### Teacher
From the perspective of LambdaFeedback, a teacher is someone who creates and manages problem sets. And so, a teacher's account has permissions to create, edit, and delete specific sets, questions, or parts. A teacher also holds all permissions that a student has.
