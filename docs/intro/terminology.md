## General Information
LambdaFeedback is an online platform allowing teachers to set work for students in a way that maximises student-teacher interaction and feedback.

## Terminology Used and Definitions
Here, the fundamental structure and terminology will be laid out.

### Evaluation Functions
An evaluation function is an algorithm that is applied to a response area, whereby the student's response is evaluated and checked. The types of evaluation functions correspond to the types of response areas.

### Final Answer
This section lies within the "Help" panel which appears upon clicking on the "Help" button. It serves as a simple container for the final answer, so that the student may have a simple means of comparing results.

This is an optional section, and so does not have to be included in any question.

### Modules
A module is a set programme of taught material. In a university setting, this would correspond to a course module.

### Questions
A question is a problem within a set, and it may contain any number of parts.

### Response Areas
A response area is the main course of interaction between a question and the student. There are different types of response area (textual, numerical, array etc.), and these correspond to the different types of information the student is required to input.

### Sets
A set is an individual set of questions, and is contained within a module. In a university setting, a set would correspond to an individual homework/tutorial sheet.

### Student
From the perspective of LambdaFeedback, a student is someone who responds to problem sets. And so, a student's account only has permissions to view and respond to problem sets.

### Teacher
From the perspective of LambdaFeedback, a teacher is someone who creates and manages problem sets. And so, a teacher's account has permissions to create, edit, and delete specific sets, questions, or parts. A teacher also holds all permissions that a student has.

### Tutorial
This section lies within the "Help" panel which appears upon clicking on the "Help" button. It is encouraged to be the first piece of guidance for the student before they look at the "Worked Solution", or "Final Answer". Thus, this section aims only to state the steps required to arrive at each stage of working within the solution.

This is an optional section, and so does not have to be included in any question.

### Worked Solution
This section lies within the "Help" panel which appears upon clicking on the "Help" button. It serves as the container for the working out of a question, where there is a clear distinction between the working, and the final answer. Furthermore, this section may be split into several steps which the student can navigate, where further steps can be hidden until reached.

This is an optional section, and so does not have to be included in any question.
