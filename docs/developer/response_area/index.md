# What is Response Area?

A Response Area is an area on the page where students input their answers.

There are different types of answers (boolean, expression, matrix, table, ...) and each of these Response Area types are linked to one or more Evaluation Functions (which Input Type is linked to which Evaluation Function is configured in the Evaluation Function page in the Admin context).

Various features can be added to the response area by the teacher (input symbols, pre-response text, post-response text, ...).

There are some pre-defined responses to correct and incorrect answers ("Correct!", "Incorrect"). The teacher can also add cases (predicted answers) for each question with specific feedbacks (e.g. "The form of your expression looks right, but there's a missing factor.")
