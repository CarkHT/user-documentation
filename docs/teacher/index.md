# Teacher and Content Author Documentation
---

In the 2022/23 academic year Lambda Feedback is in its _alpha_ version. This means that some features are incompleted, and that the documentation is not ready yet. All teacher-users should be in direct contact with someone on the development team so that you can ask for support.

Please provide feedback on the documentation as it develops.

We will populate this area more soon.
