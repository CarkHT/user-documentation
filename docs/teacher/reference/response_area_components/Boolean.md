# Boolean

A Simple True or False Response Area component. Shows two options "True" and "False" selectable by radio buttons.

## Evaluation Function Options 

### `isExactEqual`
A strict comparison in Python using '=='. This function is a basic utility but often not the function you really want to use because it is quite brittle.

## Setting The Answer
In the 'Response Area Answer' section of the editor, select the radio button corresponding to the correct answer, either 'True' or 'False'.
