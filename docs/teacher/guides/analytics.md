# Analytics Guide

Analytics begin when a question is _published_. After publishing a question for the first time it becomes available to students and their usage is logged and fed back to the student and the teacher. To ensure consistent data logging, changes to the question after publication are restricted. For example, response areas cannot changed in major ways, because the data logging would become inconsistent. 

The only way to make major changes after publication is to recreate the question (e.g. to clone it) which means losing all logging data from before that point --- including progress updates to the student.

Ensure you are ready to release your question before publishing it.
