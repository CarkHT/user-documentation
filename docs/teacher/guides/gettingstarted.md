# Getting started with Lambda Feedback as a teacher

## Basics

### Logging in

Use your Imperial Microsoft account to sign in and access your modules.  

## Adding content 

### Accessing your modules
Select the module you wish to edit (the full list of your modules can be found by clicking on the "modules" button in the upper right-hand corner). 

### Creating a new problem set
Click on "view sets" (upper left-hand corner), then "create set" (upper right-hand corner). Once a new set has been created, the name can be changed under "edit set metadata". 

### Adding a new question to your problem set
Select "add question", on the left-hand side of the display. 

The name of the question can be edited by clicking on it directly (the default is "Unamed Question"). 

### Structure of questions
Each question has a heading ("add part content") and can have multiple parts, which can be added or deleted as needed using the "add part" or "delete part" buttons. 

The heading can be used to introduce the question, while each part has several areas within it. Definitions of these parts are also given [here.](../../intro/terminology.md)

#### Part area 1: Part content
This is used to specify the question that is being asked in that part. 

#### Part area 2: Response area
Where the student types in their reponse. For a more complete overview of the different response area functionalities see the [dedicated page](../reference/response_area_components/index.md), as well as the page on [evaluation functions](../reference/evaluation_functions/index.md)

#### Part area 3: Tutorial
This area can have several parts, and can be used however the teacher sees fit. A common usage is to provide a series of successive hints to help students who are stuck on a question to find the answer.

#### Part area 4: Final answer
The student may choose to see the final answer, without workings, in this section. 

#### Part area 5: Worked solutions
This area is where the full worked solution is provided
