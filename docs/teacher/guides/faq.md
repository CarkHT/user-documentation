## How can I set parameters for evaluation functions?

The most common parameters will be visible uder the **EVALUATE** tab in the configure panel.

If there is a parameter that is not already visible it can be set using the **Advanced - raw parameters** (also under the **EVALUATE** tab) by doing the following:

4. Type in the desired value in box that appears. By default it will be assumed that the parameter value is a string. The webclient will infer other possible types based on the written input. If the setting should be a string, click the green checkmark to the top right, and if you want the inferred type click the green checkmark at the bottom right.

## How do I reorder questions?

It is only possible to reorder published questions in a set. This prevents inadvertently inserting new questions between two published ones. This ensures consistency to the student when viewing a published set as existing questions will remain in an unchanged order, with new questions being added to the bottom (unless manually changed by the teacher). 

To reorder questions:

1. Publish the questions you wish to reorder (alternatively click on the 'PUBLISH WHOLE SET' button)
2. Refresh the page
3. Drag and drop the questions into the new order - there is no need to republish the set
4. Ensure the green box pops up saying: 'questions reordered successfully'
