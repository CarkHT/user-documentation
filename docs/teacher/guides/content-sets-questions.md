Uses a milkdown component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

   | 4     | Part Content                | Here we can edit the specific content of the part (the sub question).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | 5     | Response Area               | This is the means by which the student answers a given question. It is optional to include a response area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
   | 6     | Question Help Options       | Here we may add a [Structured Tutorial](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/Documentation/terminology#structured-tutorial), a [Final Answer](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/Documentation/terminology#final-answer) ("Show Answer"), or [Worked Solutions](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/Documentation/terminology#worked-solution). These buttons are also how the student will see them, hence the name of "Show Answer". |
   | 7     | Question Help Content       | Here we can click on any of the buttons for the type of help option, and input the content of that option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
   | 8     | Teacher-Student View Toggle | Here we may toggle between the teacher view ("EDIT"), and the student view ("PREVIEW"). This way we can edit the question, but also see a preview of how it would look to the student.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | 9     | Version Options             | Here we can obtain some version control, and view earlier edits/versions of the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | 10    | Save Options                | Here we can save the question in various ways. Firstly, we can save a new version, but not publish (so the student cannot see this new version). Secondly, we can save a new version, and publish (so the student sees this new version). Lastly, we can revert to a previously publish version.                                                                                                                                 |
   | 11    | Delete                      | Here we can delete the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
   | 12    | Statistics                  | Here we can view statistics for the specific question such as how many have attempted a certain part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | 13    | Edit Guidance               | Here we can add information such as difficulty, expected time to spend, and a brief bit of general guidance for the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   | 14    | PDF Export                  | Here we (and students) can export the questions in PDF format for use offline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | 15    | Add Question                | Here we can add a new question, which would contain all the options discussed above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
