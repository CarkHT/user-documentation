# Content Creation - Sets and Questions
In this guide, we will walk through how to create [sets](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/Documentation/intro/terminology/#sets) and [questions](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/Documentation/intro/terminology/#questions).

## Sets
Upon first logging in to Lambda Feedback, we are met with a list of all of our modules. This gives us access to our modules as if we were a student, however, we want access to the modules which we ourselves have created as teachers. Thus, we must switch to the "Teacher" panel.

Once we are in the "Teacher" panel, we can select the module we wish to edit.

We then enter the module's panel. Here, we can access the list of students and teachers who have access to that module. But what we are interested in are the sets, and so we would select the "View Sets" button.
