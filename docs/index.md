# Welcome to Lambda Feedback!

| **Students**:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Teachers**:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This project began at Imperial College in 2022. The project itself, and the documentation, is currently under construction.

Lambda Feedback is a homework platform providing automated [formative feedback](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/providing-feedback-as-formative-assessment-troy-hicks). We are initially targeting [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) subjects in [Higher Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education), with a particular focus on mathematical subjects (such as mathematical methods or mechanics). The value proposition is given briefly [here](https://teachingengineers.wordpress.com/2022/07/18/computers-make-us-human/).

In these docs you can find:

</li><li> [Student guide](student/index.md)
</li><li> [Teacher guide](teacher/index.md)
</li><li> [Advanced teachers](advanced/index.md).
