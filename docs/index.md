# Welcome to Lambda Feedback

This project began at Imperial College in 2022. The documentation is currently under construction.

Lambda Feedback is a homework platform providing automated [formative feedback](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/providing-feedback-as-formative-assessment-troy-hicks). We are initially targeting [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) subjects in [Higher Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education), with a particular focus on mathematical subjects (such as mathematical methods or mechanics).

The value proposition is given briefly here:

A demonstration of the software can be found on the homepage under 'try the demo':
