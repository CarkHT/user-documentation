# Release 2023/02/10

## New Features

- 560-comment-feature-tweaks - UI improvements to the comments feature.
- 550-comment-upvotes - users can upvote comments by clicking on the heart. Sorting by upvotes is default
- 546-always-test-a-response-area-when-saving - [For teachers only] this is an invisible feature that automatically tests a response area, when closing the editing panel, to check that the correct answer is accepted as correct. A failure to pass this test will show an error and not save the response area until fixed. The reason for this feature is to catch things like empty cells in the teacher answer which, e.g. for a matrix, would make marking student answers impossible. If such errors were allowed to pass, then students would experience errors when using the response area - hence it cannot be allowed. The auto-test feature is not enabled for all response areas as some are not compatible - the option can be enabled/disabled for each response area by admins.
- 568-numeric-input-expects-string - upgrade to the numeric input type when dealing with string inputs.
