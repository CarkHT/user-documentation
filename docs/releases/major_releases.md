### Chat bots

The workspace has a 'chat' pane where users chat with a bot that has access to the question and the user's work on the question. 'Chat functions' will operate like evaluation functions --- they can be developed externally and plugged in.

### New content editor 

'Lexdown', a markdown-first version of Meta's [lexical](https://lexical.dev/). As well as a more robust general component, this upgrade allows users to:
- Resize images
- Edit raw markdown
- Preview latex including when it doesn't compile (with errors in red) 
- Improved table capabilities

### User tags
- Tag users within a module ('module tag'), to allow grouping and filtering
- Tag users across modules ('global tag'), to allow user-orientated analytics (e.g. for pastoral care)
