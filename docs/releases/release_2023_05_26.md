# Release 2023/05/26

## New Features

- 555-handwriting-response-area-upgrades - A new version of the _Expression_ input type is in use. Input by handwriting onscreen or with scanned images is an option for teachers to make available to students (default: off). Also, regardless of the input mode (type/draw/scan) the live preview now gives 'pre-submission' feedback on whether the response can be interpreted, and the Check button is only available if interpretation is successful.
- 606-publish-whole-set-causing-stats-to-disappear - The 'Publish Whole Set' button in Teacher Edit mode has been disabled because it was causing data to become unlikned in the DB, giving the effect of data like number of completed parts 'disappearing'. Existing data has now been relinked and is all visible to users. The feature that caused the problem has been disabled while we prepare a replacement to be pushed shortly.
- 612-whole-part-marked-as-done-with-more-response-areas - Student functionality. If a question part has multiple Response Areas, the logic is now that only if all Response Areas are correctly answered will the 'Mark as done' feature be automatically checked. Previously only one correct answer was required to trigger this effect.
- 585-question-simple-import-and-export - Teacher functionality. The import/export functionality has been enhanced so that it Response Area parameters, cases, and tests are now all included.
