# Release 2023/05/26

## New Features

- 555-handwriting-response-area-upgrades - Added a new version of the Expression component. Problem sets that use the component now have support for handwriting and scanning expressions in the browser, which are detected as mathematical equations using MathPix. Additionally, the new version use the preview command from evaluation functions instead of grade. Currently, there are a few issues when handwriting with an Apple Pencil, but these will be addressed in the next release.
- 606-publish-whole-set-causing-stats-to-disappear - Teacher and student functionality. The Publish Whole Set feature caused statistics to disapear for all questions that were published. Therefore, the Publish Whole Set is now temporarily disabled. Also a script was provided to re-link the statistics back to the published questions (so all statistics should be again visible). A proper fix for Publish Whole Set will be provided in the next release.
- 612-whole-part-marked-as-done-with-more-response-areas - Student functionality. A part with more response areas is marked as completed if the student provides correct answers in all response areas (not only in the 1st response area as up to now).
- 585-question-simple-import-and-export - Teacher functionality. The import/export functionality has been enhanced so that it includes parameters of a response area, cases and tests.
