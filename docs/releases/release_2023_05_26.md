# Release 2023/03/21

## New Features

- 555-handwriting-response-area-upgrades - for Louis to fill :-)
- 606-publish-whole-set-causing-stats-to-disappear - Teacher and student functionality. The Publish Whole Set feature caused statistics to disapear for all questions that were published. Therefore, the Publish Whole Set is now temporarily disabled. Also a script was provided to re-link the statistics back to the published questions (so all statistics should be again visible). A proper fix for Publish Whole Set will be provided in the next release.
- 612-whole-part-marked-as-done-with-more-response-areas - Student functionality. A part with more response areas is marked as completed if the student provides correct answers in all response areas (not only in the 1st response area as up to now).
- 585-question-simple-import-and-export - Teacher functionality. The import/export functionality has been enhanced so that it includes parameters of a response area, cases and tests.
