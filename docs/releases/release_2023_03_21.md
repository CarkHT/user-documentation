# Release 2023/03/21

## New Features

- 571-simple-teacher-comment-feed - Teacher functionality. New 'Activity feed' (formally 'Flagged Questions') contains flagged questions and comments. The teacher can filter the table to see e.g. only flags or only comments. The teacher can also sort the table e.g. to see the new activities first.
- 569-numeric-input-strips-out-strings-that-may-have-meaning - Technical dept. For the Response Area input type 'Number', additional validation added; if the input contains a non-numeric value then a relevant error message is displayed to the user (this is linked to the 573-response-area-validation-specific-errors below).
- 573-response-area-validation-specific-errors - Teacher and student functionality. More specific error messages are displayed when the user inserts a value in an incorrect format (e.g. a non-numeric value into the input that expects a number).
- 582-empty-structured-tutorial-shouldnt-display - Technical debt. When a tutorial is deleted, it is not displayed at all to students (as opposed to being blank).
- 585-question-simple-import-and-export - Teacher functionality. Export a question to a file in JSON format. Import a question from a file in JSON format. Images are not imported/exported - these need to be handled manually until a new feature is ready. This feature opens the door to file imports if content can be converted into the correct format.
- 586-question-import-add-schema-validation - Teacher functionality. When importing a question from a file, the data structure and format is validated. If the validation fails then relevant error messages displayed to the user.
